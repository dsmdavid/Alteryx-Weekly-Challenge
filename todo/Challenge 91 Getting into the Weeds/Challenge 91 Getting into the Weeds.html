<P>A big thanks and thumbs up to our Challengers who contributed a submission for our two-part challenge on analyzing social data.&nbsp; It was wonderful to see how different Challengers approached the data analysis itself and your creativity in displaying your insights!&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Some of you may know that my pre-Alteryx days included mapping and analyzing the spread of invasive aquatic species in the state of Texas.&nbsp; <A href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=774&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=giant+salvinia+takeover&amp;oq=giant+salvinia+takeover&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...83990.90009.0.92017.34.28.5.0.0.0.232.3373.11j15j1.28.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.21.2459.0..0j0i67k1j0i30k1j0i24k1.59.DR17CdHPtC8#imgrc=HFNn5g6m7VmZSM:" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Giant salvinia</A>, <A href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hydrilla&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs5tmxuYfXAhVil1QKHSGYCNgQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=774#imgrc=o1rA_FQwu82NWM:" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hydrilla</A>...this just sounds like the stuff of nightmares.&nbsp; And, for many aquatic resource specialists, it is!&nbsp; So, when I found a <A href="http://dtdapps.coloradodot.info/Otis/catalog" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">file</A> from the Colorado Department of Transportation's website on noxious weeds in the state, well, you can imagine my excitement :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For this week's Challenge, we'll build an app that would help a potential resource manager understand the coverage of noxious weeds along road segments in Colorado.&nbsp; Design an app to produce two different outputs based on a users selection to "search by road segment" or "search by weed".&nbsp; Depending on the selection, the app should produce a chart of the different weeds and their coverage levels (if selecting to search by road segment) or a table of the road segments and coverage of a weed (if choosing to search by weed).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Happy Challenging!&nbsp; Feel free to up the ante from my suggested outputs to maps, additional output information, or more aesthetically pleasing reports!&nbsp;</P>
