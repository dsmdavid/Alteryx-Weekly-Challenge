<P>Last week's solution can be found <A href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenge/Weekly-Challenge-141-Examination-Data-Simulation/td-p/326336" target="_blank">here</A>!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This week's challenge is around assigning the right income tax rate to each salary. Your goal is to count the number of people associated with each tax rate.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="How many feel at tax time." style="width: 334px;"><img src="https://pvsmt99345.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/48514i339EEE1129D9C24A/image-size/large?v=1.0&amp;px=999" title="cat.gif" alt="How many feel at tax time." /><span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();">How many feel at tax time.</span></span></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>In our starting workflow, you'll find three datasets:<BR />1) A grid of 100 employees from 26 companies. Before everyone gets worried, yes, I randomly generate this salary data and it is not representative of the population! Do note that each salary has a 'I' or 'J" representing whether this salary will be filed jointly or individually</P>
<P><BR />2) A list of the company names<BR />3) A tax table with the income rates. Notice that there is not a range in the tax table. You must infer the range based on when the next tax rate starts.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Easy Path:<BR />1) Solve this problem as is.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hard Path:<BR />1) Do not use: Join, Crosstab, Transpose, Multi-field Formula, or Multi-Row Formula</P>
