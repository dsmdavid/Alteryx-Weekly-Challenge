<P>Welcome all to SANTALYTICS PART TWO!<BR />If you are just checking out Santalytics for the first time, please read the announcement blog for the inside scoop: <A href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alter-Nation-Blog/SANTALYTICS-2018/ba-p/339380" target="_blank">#SANTALYTICS 2018</A><BR /> <BR /> In <A href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Weekly-Challenge/Challenge-145-SANTALYTICS-2018-Part-1/td-p/340333" target="_blank">Part 1</A>, we took a look at IRS data and invited you to help us identify a local charity. This weeks challenge is designed to replicate how we might allocate those donation dollars to serve the needs of the organization we identified - A Precious Child. One of the key focus areas of said charity is to provide basic necessities to children in need who would otherwise go without.<BR /> <BR /> Community's promise in this challenge is to donate $20 per solution between 12/17-12/21 with a $2,000 max! Solving for good? Now that's something I can get on board with. What's more, your solution will almost surely change the answer to the problem. Since you are adding a solution, you will trying to solve our problem with $20 more than the previous solver.<BR /> <BR /> In the great tradition of Santalytics, we do not provide a fixed answer, but will give some rules to guide you through the challenge:<BR /> <BR /> 1) You'll need to scrape the Community to determine the number of solutions that have been posted (for ease you can just count .yxmd/.yxzp attachments). For those who want to skip this and take the 'easy' path, a macro is attached. We realize that the number of attachments != the number of solutions, but we can pad it a little right?!<BR /> 2) The number of 'solutions' * $20 will be the donated value you are working with<BR /> 3) The item data set (StoreData.yxdb) has two types of items - hygiene and clothing. Try to categorize them as you think they should and make sure that you donation is split 50/50 across the two categories to make sure we aren't heavily weighted to once side<BR /> 4) Make sure the items has a 4+ star rating, 10+ reviews and is in stock<BR /> 5) No one item can be purchased more than 10x for diversity of donations.<BR /> <BR /> After you're done, post up your solution. We might just use your solution as the shopping list!<BR /> <BR /> NOTE: This will be the last challenge of 2018. We will be resuming challenges in 2019-01-07.</P>
