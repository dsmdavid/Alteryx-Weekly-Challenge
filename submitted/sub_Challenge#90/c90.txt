This week’s Challenge is a continuation of last week’s analytic adventure!

 

Now that you’ve analyzed the Twitter data containing hashtags related to the most recent assembly of the United Nations, you’re ready for your next Challenge: visualizing the data to tell a compelling story about the insights you’ve found.  You may choose to communicate your findings through a Tableau dashboard (and you want to try that new cool thing you learned at last week’s TC!), or you may find that your findings are best explained with a viz you can whip up in Plotly.  As for me, I’ll be spending some time playing with the Visual Layout Tool in Designer to create a report that’s part of an output from the app I created. 

 

How will you Challenge yourself to visually tell the story behind your insightful analysis?  Share your completed viz below to complete this week’s Challenge!
