<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Santalytics this year was all about getting to know each corner of the Alteryx Community better, and seeing a little of what 2019 had to offer in the process. <A href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alter-Nation-Blog/SANTALYTICS-2019-Oh-no-Santa-s-lost-in-time/ba-p/497733" target="_self">The Santalytics 2019 Scavenger Hunt</A> culminates here with Weekly Challenge #194.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Once you have the answers from each of the <A href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/forums/filteredbylabelpage/board-id/community-introduction/label-name/santalytics" target="_self">nine scavenger hunt clues</A>, this challenge isn't too tricky! Simply match each day's answer to the corresponding tool rank in the <A href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Engine-Works-Blog/The-Periodic-Table-of-Alteryx-tools/ba-p/64120" target="_self">Periodic Table of Alteryx Tools</A> chart, and drop that tool into the workflow - no configuration necessary (although you may need to run the workflow after certain tools to populate the outgoing metadata).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Maybe you'll learn something about a tool you've never used before - check the data as it goes out of each tool to see what it does. The final answer is a single number coming out of the last tool (AKA the year that Santa is trapped in).</P>
