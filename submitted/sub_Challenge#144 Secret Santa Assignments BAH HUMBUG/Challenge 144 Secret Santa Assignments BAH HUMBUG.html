<P>This week we are going to take a little breather before we dive into some SANTALYTICS next week. Just to get a little warm up going we are going to generate some secret Santa pairings (thanks to <a href="https://community.alteryx.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/18746">@Carlithian</a>&nbsp;for the Challenge idea)! For our beginning users, try to generate pairs of people so nobody is picked twice or picks themselves! For a little more spice, we added the field 'scroogieness', <EM>which is certainly a word I didn't just make up just now</EM>. OK - it's more of a reflection of the character crabby and miserly 'Scrooge' in a Christmas Carol pre-visitation of three-spirits. The higher the 'scroogieness' is on a scale of 1-10 the more curmudgeonly the person. Try to create unique pairings where 'net scroogieness' does not exceed 13.</P>
