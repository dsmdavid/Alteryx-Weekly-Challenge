<P>Last week's solution is now up - find it here!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This week, we are looking at a few accounts. In this set of data, there are 4 accounts. The first row of every account represents the number of credits/debits against the account, and the second row represents the actual credits and debits paid against the account in the order they were paid. Your task is to find the credits and debits where the sum of debits and credits BEFORE any transaction is equal to the sum of debits and credits AFTER it. Please count the transactions from 0 to match the answer. Below is a picture that illustrates the logic of which transactions should be captured. The picture represents the second account.</P>
